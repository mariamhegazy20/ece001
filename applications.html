    <h1>ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS</h1>
    <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>

    <p>
        When humans communicate with each other using language, they employ, almost effortlessly, extremely complex and still little understood
        processes. It has been very difficult to develope computer system capale of generating and "understanding" even fragments of naturel 
        language, such as English. One source of the difficult is that language has evolved as a communication meduim between intelligent beings.
        Its primary use is for transmitting a bit of "mental structure" from one brain to another under cricumstances in which each brain processes
        large, highly similar, surrounding mental structures that serve as a common context. Furthermore, part of these similar, contextual mental
        structures allows each participant to know that the other also processes using it during communication

    <h2>Automatic Programming</h2>
    <p>
        the task of writing a computer progrem is related both to theorem proving and to robotics. Much of the basic research in automatic Programming,
        theorem proning, and robot problem solving overlaps. In a sense, existing compilers already do "automatic Programming" they take in a 
        complete source code specification of what a program is to accomplish, and they write an object code program to do it. what we mean here by 
        automatic Programming might be described as s "supercompiler"or a programthat could take in a very high level description of what the
        program is to accomplish and produce a program. The high level discription might be a precise statement in a formal language, such as 
        the predicate calculus, or it might be a loose description, say, in English, that would require furthur dialogue between the system 
        and the user in order to resolve ambiguites.

    <h2>Robotics</h2>

    <p>
        The problem of controlling the physical actions of a mobile robot might not seem to require much intelligence. Even small childern are 
        able to navigate successfully through their environment and to mainpilate items, such as light switches, toy blocks, eating utensils,etc.
        However these same tasks, preformed almost unconsciously by humans, performed by a machine requiremany of the same abilites used in 
        solving more intellectualy demanding problems. Research on robots or robotics has helped to develope many AI ideas. It has led to several 
        techniques for modeling states of the world and for describing the process of change from one world state to another. It has led to a better 
        understanding of how to generate plans for action sequances and how to monitor the execution of these plans. complex robot control problems 
        have forced us to develop methods for planning at high levels of abstraction, ignoring details, and then planning at lower and lower levels,
        where details become important.
