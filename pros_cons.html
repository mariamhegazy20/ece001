            <p>
                 Artificial Intelligence and the science of robotics is used in mining and other fuel exploration processes. 
                These complex machines help to explore the ocean floor and overcome human limitations. Due to the programming of the robots, 
                they can perform a more laborious task with extra hard work and with greater responsibility. Moreover, they do not wear out easily.

            <h3>High cost</h3>
            <p>
                It’s true that AI comes with a high cost, but there is no such thing as a free lunch too. It requires huge costs as it is a 
                complex machine. Apart from the installation cost, its repair and maintenance also require huge costs. The software programs 
                need frequent upgradation and cater to the needs of the changing environment.Also, if there is a breakdown, the cost of 
                procurement is very high. With that, recovery requires huge time too.

            <p>
                Logic above all! Highly advanced organizations have digital assistants which help them to interact with the users and save 
                the need for human resources.Right program decisions can be taken if they are worked upon rationally. But, with humans, 
                emotions come along. When artificial thinkers, there is no distraction at all. They don’t have an emotional side, and that makes 
                robots think logically. Emotions are not associated with them and therefore the mood doesn’t hamper the efficiency. 
                Thus they are always productive.

              <p>
                No matter how smart a machine becomes, it can never replicate a human. Machines are rational but, very inhuman as they don’t 
                possess emotions and moral values. They don’t know what is ethical and what’s legal and because of this, don’t have their own 
                judgment making skills. They do what they are told to do and therefore the judgment of right or wrong is nil for them. 
                If they encounter a situation that is unfamiliar to them then they perform incorrectly or else break down in such situations.

                <p>
                    The same old task, a task that doesn’t add value is of no use. Also, repetitive jobs are monotonous in nature and can be carried 
                    out with the help of machine intelligence. Machines think faster than humans and can perform various functions at the same time. 
                    It can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks and its parameters are adjusted. This is not possible with humans as their speed 
                    and time can’t be calculated on the basis of parameters.

                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence cannot be improved with experience, they can perform the same function again if no different command 
                    is given to them. With time, it can lead to wear and tear. It stores a lot of data but the way it can be accessed and used is 
                    very different from human intelligence.Also, they can’t cope up with the dynamic environment and so they are unable to alter 
                    their responses to changing environments. We are constantly bombarded by the question of whether it is really exciting to replace 
                    humans with machines.Artificial intelligence doesn’t have feelings and because of which there is nothing like working with a whole 
                    heart or with full passion for them. There is no sense of belonging or togetherness or a human touch. They fail to distinguish between a 
                    hardworking individual and an inefficient individua

                <p>
                    A machine doesn’t require breaks like the way humans do. They are programmed for long hours and can continuously perform 
                    without getting bored or distracted. The machine does not get tired, even if it has to work for consecutive hours. 
                    This is a major benefit over humans, who need a rest from time to time to be efficient. However, in the case of machines, 
                    their efficiency is not affected by any external factor and it does not get in the way of continuous work.

                <h3>Creativityis not the key for AI</h3>
                <p>
                    Machines can’t be creative. They can only do what they are being taught or commanded. Though they help in designing and 
                    creating, they can’t match the power of a human brain.Humans are sensitive and intellectuals and they are very creative too. 
                    They can generate ideas, can think out of the box. They see, hear, think and feel which machine can’t. Their thoughts are 
                    guided by the feelings which completely lacks in machines. No matter how much a machine outgrows, it can’t inherent intuitive 
                    abilities of the human brain and can’t replicate it.

                <h3>Right decision making</h3>
                <p>
                    The complete absence of emotions from a machine makes it more efficient as they are able to make the right decisions in 
                    a short span of time. The best example of this is its usage in healthcare. The integration of AI tools in the healthcare 
                    sector has improved the efficiency of treatments by minimizing the risk of false diagnosis.

                <p>
                    This one is the riskiest and can have severe effects. With capital intensive technologies, human-intensive requirements have 
                    decreased in some industries. If in the future, human beings don’t add to their skills, then in no time, we can see that they will 
                    be replaced with machines. The major issue of the GDP being stagnant or not growing at the expected rate is unemployment. 
                    People don’t possess the required skills that are in demand. There is a huge demand and supply gap because of this.
