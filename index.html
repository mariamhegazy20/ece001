    Artificail Intelligence(AI) is the part of computer science concerned with designing intelligent computer system, that is,
    system that exhitib the characteristics we associate with Intelligence in human behavior, understanding languages, learning,
    reasoning, solving problems and so on. Many belive that insights into the nature of the mind can be gaind by studing the operation 
    of such programs. Since the field first evolved in the mid-1950s, AI researches have invented dozens of programming techniques that sopport 
    some sort of intelligent behavior.
</p>
<p>
    There every evidencecthat these developments will lead to a new intelligent technology that may have dramatic effects on our socaity.
    Experimental AI system have already generated interest and enthusiasm in industry and are being developed commerically. These experimental 
    systems include programs that:
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Solve some hard problems in chemistry, biology, geology, enginering and mechanics at human expert levels of performance.</li>

    <h1>ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE HISTORY </h1>
    <p>
        In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of artificially intelligent robots.
        It began with the “heartless” Tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the humanoid robot that impersonated Maria in Metropolis.
        By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence culturally
         assimilated in their minds. One such person was Alan Turing, a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of 
         artificial intelligence. Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions,
         so why can’t machines do the same thing? This was the logical framework of his 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which he 
         discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence. 
         <br><br>
         <h2>the Development in Last Five years</h2>
         Five years later, the proof of concept was initialized through Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon’s, Logic Theorist.
          The Logic Theorist was a program designed to mimic the problem solving skills of a human and was funded by Research and Development
        (RAND) Corporation. It’s considered by many to be the first artificial intelligence program and was presented at the Dartmouth Summer
         Research Project on Artificial Intelligence (DSRPAI) hosted by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky in 1956. In this historic conference,
          McCarthy, imagining a great collaborative effort, brought together top researchers from various fields for an open ended discussion 
        on artificial intelligence, the term which he coined at the very event. Sadly, the conference fell short of McCarthy’s expectations; 
        people came and went as they pleased, and there was failure to agree on standard methods for the field. Despite this, 
        everyone whole-heartedly aligned with the sentiment that AI was achievable. The significance of this event cannot be undermined as
        it catalyzed the next twenty years of AI research.
        <br><br>

        <h2>Artificail Intelligence Timeline</h2>
        From 1957 to 1974, AI flourished. Computers could store more information and became faster, cheaper, and more accessible. 
        Machine learning algorithms also improved and people got better at knowing which algorithm to apply to their problem. 
        Early demonstrations such as Newell and Simon’s General Problem Solver and Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA showed promise toward the goals
         of problem solving and the interpretation of spoken language respectively. These successes, as well as the advocacy of leading researchers
        (namely the attendees of the DSRPAI) convinced government agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to fund AI
        research at several institutions. The government was particularly interested in a machine that could transcribe and translate spoken 
        language as well as high throughput data processing. Optimism was high and expectations were even higher. In 1970 Marvin Minsky told Life 
        Magazine, “from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.” However, while the 
        basic proof of principle was there, there was still a long way to go before the end goals of natural language processing, abstract thinking, 
        and self-recognition could be achieved.

    <h1>ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS</h1>
    <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
    <p><img src="pictures/natura language.png" alt="nature language processing"style="float:right;width:250px;hight:300px"></p>
    <p>
        When humans communicate with each other using language, they employ, almost effortlessly, extremely complex and still little understood
        processes. It has been very difficult to develope computer system capale of generating and "understanding" even fragments of naturel 
        language, such as English. One source of the difficult is that language has evolved as a communication meduim between intelligent beings.
        Its primary use is for transmitting a bit of "mental structure" from one brain to another under cricumstances in which each brain processes
        large, highly similar, surrounding mental structures that serve as a common context. Furthermore, part of these similar, contextual mental
        structures allows each participant to know that the other also processes using it during communication
    </p>
    <h2>Automatic Programming</h2>
    <p>
        the task of writing a computer progrem is related both to theorem proving and to robotics. Much of the basic research in automatic Programming,
        theorem proning, and robot problem solving overlaps. In a sense, existing compilers already do "automatic Programming" they take in a 
        complete source code specification of what a program is to accomplish, and they write an object code program to do it. what we mean here by 
        automatic Programming might be described as s "supercompiler"or a programthat could take in a very high level description of what the
        program is to accomplish and produce a program. The high level discription might be a precise statement in a formal language, such as 
        the predicate calculus, or it might be a loose description, say, in English, that would require furthur dialogue between the system 
        and the user in order to resolve ambiguites.
    </p>
    <h2>Robotics</h2>
    <p><img src="pictures/robotics.jpg" alt="robotics"style="float:right;width:250px;hight:300px"></p>
    <p>
        The problem of controlling the physical actions of a mobile robot might not seem to require much intelligence. Even small childern are 
        able to navigate successfully through their environment and to mainpilate items, such as light switches, toy blocks, eating utensils,etc.
        However these same tasks, preformed almost unconsciously by humans, performed by a machine requiremany of the same abilites used in 
        solving more intellectualy demanding problems. Research on robots or robotics has helped to develope many AI ideas. It has led to several 
        techniques for modeling states of the world and for describing the process of change from one world state to another. It has led to a better 
        understanding of how to generate plans for action sequances and how to monitor the execution of these plans. complex robot control problems 
        have forced us to develop methods for planning at high levels of abstraction, ignoring details, and then planning at lower and lower levels,
        where details become important.

            <p>
                 Artificial Intelligence and the science of robotics is used in mining and other fuel exploration processes. 
                These complex machines help to explore the ocean floor and overcome human limitations. Due to the programming of the robots, 
                they can perform a more laborious task with extra hard work and with greater responsibility. Moreover, they do not wear out easily.

                It’s true that AI comes with a high cost, but there is no such thing as a free lunch too. It requires huge costs as it is a 
                complex machine. Apart from the installation cost, its repair and maintenance also require huge costs. The software programs 
                need frequent upgradation and cater to the needs of the changing environment.Also, if there is a breakdown, the cost of 
                procurement is very high. With that, recovery requires huge time too.

                the need for human resources.Right program decisions can be taken if they are worked upon rationally. But, with humans, 
                emotions come along. When artificial thinkers, there is no distraction at all. They don’t have an emotional side, and that makes 
                robots think logically. Emotions are not associated with them and therefore the mood doesn’t hamper the efficiency. 
                Thus they are always productive.

                possess emotions and moral values. They don’t know what is ethical and what’s legal and because of this, don’t have their own 
                judgment making skills. They do what they are told to do and therefore the judgment of right or wrong is nil for them. 
                If they encounter a situation that is unfamiliar to them then they perform incorrectly or else break down in such situations.

                    out with the help of machine intelligence. Machines think faster than humans and can perform various functions at the same time. 
                    It can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks and its parameters are adjusted. This is not possible with humans as their speed 
                    and time can’t be calculated on the basis of parameters.

                    is given to them. With time, it can lead to wear and tear. It stores a lot of data but the way it can be accessed and used is 
                    very different from human intelligence.Also, they can’t cope up with the dynamic environment and so they are unable to alter 
                    their responses to changing environments. We are constantly bombarded by the question of whether it is really exciting to replace 
                    humans with machines.Artificial intelligence doesn’t have feelings and because of which there is nothing like working with a whole 
                    heart or with full passion for them. There is no sense of belonging or togetherness or a human touch. They fail to distinguish between a 
                    hardworking individual and an inefficient individua

                <p>
                    A machine doesn’t require breaks like the way humans do. They are programmed for long hours and can continuously perform 
                    without getting bored or distracted. The machine does not get tired, even if it has to work for consecutive hours. 
                    This is a major benefit over humans, who need a rest from time to time to be efficient. However, in the case of machines, 
                    their efficiency is not affected by any external factor and it does not get in the way of continuous work.

                    creating, they can’t match the power of a human brain.Humans are sensitive and intellectuals and they are very creative too. 
                    They can generate ideas, can think out of the box. They see, hear, think and feel which machine can’t. Their thoughts are 
                    guided by the feelings which completely lacks in machines. No matter how much a machine outgrows, it can’t inherent intuitive 
                    abilities of the human brain and can’t replicate it.

                    The complete absence of emotions from a machine makes it more efficient as they are able to make the right decisions in 
                    a short span of time. The best example of this is its usage in healthcare. The integration of AI tools in the healthcare 
                    sector has improved the efficiency of treatments by minimizing the risk of false diagnosis.

                    decreased in some industries. If in the future, human beings don’t add to their skills, then in no time, we can see that they will 
                    be replaced with machines. The major issue of the GDP being stagnant or not growing at the expected rate is unemployment. 
                    People don’t possess the required skills that are in demand. There is a huge demand and supply gap because of this.

    <h1>5 Pioneers in the Field of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>
        Over the years, there have been a number of notable contributors – pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence. 
        Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the science and pursuit of the machine-possession and use of real intelligence, 
        similar in many ways to our own intelligence. Since ancient times, we have sought a dream to enjoy the benefits of artificial minds 
        doing our bidding. As a direct result of this dream, the world has seen a number of unique and very important contributors arise, 
        greatly furthering the science of AI at each instance. We take a look at five of these pivotal pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Alan Turing</h2>
            <p>
                Alan Turing was an English inventor, mathematician, biologist, and computer scientist. His Turing Machine is one of the first, 
                basic computers to be created. It was this work with computer engineering that led Turing to be an important figure in all AI 
                to come.In 1950, Alan Turing published a groundbreaking paper that introduced computerized thought to the masses. Next, 
                after admitting the difficulty in measuring machine “thought”, he devised the now-famous Turing Test. The test, still a matter 
                of standards today, holds that if a computer can carry dialogue with a person via a printer, this most basic communication is 
                true proof of that machine’s “thinking”.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Ross Quillian</h2>
            <p>
                It is hard to get much detailed information about the true Ross Quillian. From what we do know, Quillian was a leading scientist and researcher 
                during the 1960’s in the fields of electronics and communications. His work with Project SYNTHEX is most widely concerned as his foremost 
                contribution to artificial intelligence.
                <br> Project SYNTHEX, Quillian developed the first semantic web that would be used in AI applications. The semantic web is important because 
                it is a map of words and concepts that a computer can use to understand relations. For example, when you think of the word “breakfast”, 
                your brain understands there to be other words and concepts associated with that same word. These might include things like syrup, hunger, 
                plate, eat, and so on. Quillian’s semantic web was a missing, crucial component to AI before this but now in existence, provided that necessary 
                map of relational understanding to computers.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Edward Feigenbaum</h2>
            <p>
                Edward Feigenbaum is another important contributor to the science of AI. His computer science career began remarkably while still 
                in college, creating EPAM, one of the first computer models of human learning for his thesis project. Later in his career, his 
                involvement in several projects at Stanford University showed his continued brilliance.
                <br>
                Of these continued projects, Dendral was the most important to AI sciences. Started in 1965, Dendral used computer systems to identify 
                and communicate the presence of diseases when given spectrometer readings of blood samples. This was the first use of an AI “expert 
                system”, or one specializing in a singular area of study or knowledge.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>IBM</h2>
            <p>
                Another important pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence is not just a single person but a company. 
                IBM hit a major milestone with its development and final creation of Deep Blue. Deep Blue was an artificial intelligence system 
                designed specifically for playing chess. The ultimate goal of the system was indeed to defeat a human chessmaster for the first time
                 using AI.
            <br>
                After a long period of development and trials, Deep Blue played against world-renowned chessmaster Garry Kasparov. 
                The date was February 10, 1996, and amid great publicity and public attention, it would be the first documented case of AI 
                competing and winning against humans in a contest of any sort.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Marvin Minsky</h2>
            <p>
                The final of our five, important pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence is Marvin Minsky. Minsky’s contributions to 
                the field of AI were many and continued until his death in early 2016. It was Minsky that coined the term “perceptrons” in 
                his groundbreaking work concerning artificial neural networks. Minsky also created several, new models for AI systems and 
                continued to contribute to the work of others in the AI field for many years to come. In addition he was valued as an adviser 
                to the entertainment industry, providing expert advice on several projects including Stanley Kubrick’s “A Space Odyssey”.
