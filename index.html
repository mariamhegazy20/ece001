    Artificail Intelligence(AI) is the part of computer science concerned with designing intelligent computer system, that is,
    system that exhitib the characteristics we associate with Intelligence in human behavior, understanding languages, learning,
    reasoning, solving problems and so on. Many belive that insights into the nature of the mind can be gaind by studing the operation 
    of such programs. Since the field first evolved in the mid-1950s, AI researches have invented dozens of programming techniques that sopport 
    some sort of intelligent behavior.

<p>
    There every evidencecthat these developments will lead to a new intelligent technology that may have dramatic effects on our socaity.
    Experimental AI system have already generated interest and enthusiasm in industry and are being developed commerically. These experimental 
    systems include programs that:
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Solve some hard problems in chemistry, biology, geology, enginering and mechanics at human expert levels of performance.</li>
        <li>Manipulate robotic devices to perform some useful, repetitive, sensory motor tasks,....</li>
        <li>Answer questions posed in simple dialects of english or any other language.</li>
    </ol>
